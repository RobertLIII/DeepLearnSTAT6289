# LSTM Neural Network for Time Series Prediction

This notebook explores the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for time series forecasting using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. It was developed as part of STAT 6289: Deep Learning at George Washington University.

## üìà Project Overview

The project demonstrates how to:

- Preprocess time series data for supervised learning
- Build and train an LSTM model for sequence prediction
- Evaluate model performance and forecast future values

The dataset used is synthetically generated to simulate realistic periodic behavior and noise, making it suitable for learning core LSTM modeling techniques.

## üîç Key Features

- Custom sequence-to-sequence framing for time series data
- Use of Keras LSTM layers with adjustable hyperparameters
- Walk-forward validation and MSE-based evaluation
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual values

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RobertLIII/DeepLearnSTAT6289.git
   cd DeepLearnSTAT6289
   ```
2. Open `LSTM.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

## üìö Background

LSTMs are a class of recurrent neural networks effective for sequential data. This notebook walks through how to apply them to time series forecasting, with emphasis on practical implementation over theory.
